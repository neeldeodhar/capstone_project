# capstone_project
This repository is the capstone project for the bootcamp; and it contains a diamond price prediction project.
Various dataset features i.e. cut, clarity, depth, table etc have been used for the above.

The machine learning model (supervised) in the project can be used by any diamond merchants to predict the price of the diamonds based on the characteristics (dataset features) discussed above.


There is always scope for improvement in the code by using different values of parameters in each of the classification, regression and clustering sections:
1. the classifier section is used to implement different classification techniques on the given dataset.
2. the regressor section is  used to build diamond price estimator by using its characteristics.
3. the clustering section will be used towards customer segmentation.
